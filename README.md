Lead Score Case Study - Predictive Model for Lead Conversion
Problem Statement:
X Education, an online course provider, seeks to enhance its lead conversion process. The company wishes to identify and prioritize potential leads by assigning a lead score between 0 and 100. This score should effectively differentiate between high-conversion probability ("hot") leads and low-conversion probability ("cold") leads, assisting the sales team in targeting the most promising prospects.

Data Overview:
The provided dataset contains approximately 9000 data points, including attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, Last Activity, etc. The target variable 'Converted' indicates whether a lead was converted (1) or not (0). The categorical variables include levels such as 'Select,' which need to be addressed due to their resemblance to null values.

Goals of the Case Study:

Construct a Logistic Regression model to assign lead scores ranging from 0 to 100.
Create a model flexible enough to accommodate potential future requirements as outlined in a separate document.
Address the company's evolving needs and challenges with the logistic regression model.
Expected Results:
This case study will deliver:

A well-commented Jupyter notebook showcasing the logistic regression model, conversion predictions, and evaluation metrics.
A detailed Word document providing solutions to the presented problems, reflecting the insights derived from the logistic regression model.
A comprehensive presentation outlining the entire analysis process, including a concise problem statement, the approach employed, results interpretation, and key visualizations.
Through this analysis, X Education aims to elevate its lead conversion strategy, optimize resource allocation, and enhance its overall business performance.
